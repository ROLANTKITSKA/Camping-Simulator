# Camping-Simulator

This is an interactive camping simulator using C# and Windows Forms, featuring a dynamic map interface for selecting camping regions and setting up tents.

Implemented a region selection system with clickable areas on the map, providing real-time feedback on terrain suitability, humidity, and climate conditions for camping.

Designed a tent setup mechanism allowing users to adjust tent parameters such as angle, pressure, and light intensity, with real-time visual updates and validation for safe setup. 
Created a lighting system with adjustable intensity and color options, supporting different camping activities (e.g., group activities, evening events, parties) with dynamic visual effects.

Integrated a weather simulation system using a timer to generate random weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and climate emergencies (e.g., storms).

Added emergency response features, such as deploying protective sails during strong winds and providing shelter recommendations during severe weather events.
